# Homebrew cask for Leash — STAGED, not yet live.
#
# This goes live the first time `scripts/release.sh --mac` produces a notarized
# Developer-ID DMG (gated on the signing certificate). On each release, release.sh
# fills in `version` + `sha256` and publishes this file to the tap repo
# `adrianmcgee/homebrew-leash`, after which:
#
#   brew install --cask adrianmcgee/leash/leash
#
# The placeholder sha256 below is intentional — `brew` will refuse to install
# until release.sh stamps the real checksum, so a half-staged cask can't mislead.
